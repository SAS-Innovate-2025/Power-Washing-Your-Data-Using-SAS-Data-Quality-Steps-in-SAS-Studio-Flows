# Power-Washing-Your-Data-Using-SAS-Data-Quality-Steps-in-SAS-Studio-Flows

Cleaning data to prepare for reporting, analysis, machine learning, and more is a common task which can take a lot of time, money, and effort to complete. Update your data cleaning process with point-and-click data quality steps in SAS Studio Flows! In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn about the Clean Data, Parse Data, and Match Codes steps, which enable a wide range of data quality operations. Perform tasks like standardization, value analysis, parsing, or extraction on one variable (or several) with only a few nodes. In addition, you'll learn how to enhance your results with generated code snippets.
